# Brazzers

In general this is a terrific site. The content is quality and some of the scenarios are imaginative enough to be genuinely funny. I particularly like that they showcase the best angles for different girls. It's not enough to get naked: they instead emphasize the most attractive angles.

On the negative side: since 2016 they've used Kerian Lee far too many times. He's difficult to watch but it seems like the girls like him. They also seem to prefer girls who've had a lot of cosmetic surgery. Which is fine as far as it goes, but I tend to prefer the natural look.

Occasionally I'm in the mood for bimbos, however, and Brazzers is far and away the best place to find them.

# Digital Playground

DP used to be a much better website. They had really innovative blockbuster movies that explored different angles and gave girls a chance to perform. I heard on the Holly Randall Unfiltered podcast that things changed because the site was acquired by Mind Geek.

I bought a subscription originally because it was the best place to find videos of Stoya. But she's long since retired. Same with Jenna Haze, Aria Alexander, Riley Steele, Jesse Jane and others. This was my first step into the Porn Portal so my subscription is currently active through 2023.

# Mofos

I regret this subscription, though it is tied to my Digital Playground subscription so it continues as long as I pay for DP. The only good scenes I have from Mofos use Bailey Brooke or another girl (slender blonde) who's name escapes me.

# Reality Kings

There is something for everyone on this site. I don't generally love the site. But browsing around always yields a decent reward. I don't like how their scenes are filmed. But for the right girl it's worthwhile.

# Live Jasmin

This is generally a huge waste of time and money. I signed up originally because of the novelty but I was too afraid to use my real name and so I didn't get the benefit of having a girl tell me to cum by name.

My favorite models over time have been:
* PerfectSlut01
* CelinneAnn
* BridgetLiv
* LexiMoon
* EmmaWilder

But these days the only girl who keeps me coming back is [Delaney Kade](https://www.delaneykade.com/), who's screen name is `DarlingDelaney`.
